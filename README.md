# Drift-Sentinel-AI
Real-time AI reliability and PPE drift monitoring system with explainability and risk-aware controls.

🛡️ Drift Sentinel

Unsupervised Reliability Monitoring for Vision-Based AI Systems
Drift Sentinel is a real-time monitoring framework that operates alongside an existing computer vision model to continuously assess its reliability.
Instead of waiting for ground-truth labels or accuracy reports, the system tracks shifts in input data, prediction confidence, and entropy to detect silent model failures early.

🚀 Key Features

1.Unsupervised drift detection (no ground-truth labels required)

2.Real-time confidence & entropy monitoring
3.Operational Risk Budget with safe-degradation logic
4.Feature-level drift explainability
5.Black Box audit logging for post-incident analysis
6.Supervisor-controlled re-calibration
7.Works with live webcam or pre-recorded video feeds
